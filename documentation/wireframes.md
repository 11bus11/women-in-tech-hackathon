# Wireframes

The following wireframes were created and designed by Wesley Luiz de Souza.
We used wireframes to guide the development of the website, and made adjustments to the UI/UX as needed throughout the project. While we aimed to stay true to the original wireframes, some changes were made to ensure a better user experience.

There were several designs pertaining to the design of the landing page, description, biographies section, AI selection, AI chat and general UI/UX design.

These wireframes have mostly been adhered to save for slight minor differences, however have served the hack-a-thon team in developing a consistent and identifiable brand across the web application.
