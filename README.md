# **Women In Tech Hack-a-thon, March 2023**

**Team name:** TeamAI

**Project name:** ChatWIT

## Meet ChatWIT!

ChatWIT (Women in Tech) uses the power of AI to enable you to chat directly with a range of pioneering women in tech from history to the present day.

Choose the woman you would like to chat to, and ask her any questions you have about her life and work, achievements and obstacles, and more!  

### Representation

ChatWIT aims to help contribute to the visibility and representation of women in tech, by reminding all of us that there have always been women who have claimed their place in the "traditionally male-dominated field" of computing, and enabling us to learn more about these women and their accomplishments.  

### Mentoring

ChatWIT's Women in Tech can also act as an AI mentor to people starting out in the field of tech by sharing the stories of their lives, the barriers they overcame and their tips for success.

### Overcoming imposter syndrome

The saying goes that, "You can't be what you can't see". ChatWIT acts as a link to just a selection of the many the women who have made their mark in the tech field, including women of colour, to reassert that women of varied backgrounds do have and have always had a well-deserved place in the tech industry.

## **Creating a Branch**

There are multiple ways to create a branch in your IDE, but this is one of the easiest:

* Go to the GitHub repository for Women-In-Tech-Hackathon.

* You should be able to locate "Branch" (it'll normally say "1 branch" if there's just one). Click it.

* Then click "New branch". You can name it whatever but I would recommend calling it your name (in my case, I've named it "keiron").

* Done. 

* Once you've done this, in your IDE, go right down to the branch label (I will attach a photo).

![branch-label](/documentation/PR%20and%20branch%20instructions/branch%20label.png)

* Click this and it will bring up a list of existing branches. Click the one you have made.

* You should notice then that the branch label has changed to your named branch.


**Useful commands**

A list of useful commands when you're working from branches are:

`git status` (tells you which branch you're on and if you're behind/ahead of `main` branch)

`git pull origin main` (this is very important, please git pull everytime you merge a pull request as it avoids merge conflicts)

`git add` 

`git commit -m "(your commit message)"`

`git push origin (your branch name)` (I recommend just going into source control and clicking `Sync changes`)

`git switch (branch name)` (allows you to switch branch instantaneously)


## **Creating a Pull Request (known as a "PR")**

When you've pushed changes to your branch, you can then head over to the GitHub repository for Women-In-Tech-Hackathon and _normally_ there appears an unmissable message saying that you can `Compare & pull request`.

![](/documentation/PR%20and%20branch%20instructions/pull%20request%20message.png)

In case you've pushed changes and this message doesn't appear, don't worry, just go back into "branches", find your name, and alongside your branch name, there'll be a button for "New Pull Request". I've attached the following photo for reference.

![pull-request-button](/documentation/PR%20and%20branch%20instructions/new%20pull%20request.png)

* Once you've begun a PR, it will appear in the "Pull Requests" (next to "Issues") part of the GitHub repository, and you can manage it from there before merging your changes with `main`.

* Please always tag reviewers (you can tag anybody or everybody) to take a look at the changes before merging.

**Potential problems**

When a lot of PRs go up, a "merge conflict" can happen. This is okay and it's bound to happen, it's part of the experience of a hackathon as well (and also working in a team). It can occur for a variety of complex reasons.

An example of how it can occur is when changes are being made by various branches on the same content (say that "keiron" and "erik" are working on the README.md, and then we do a PR, and one of us has forgotten to `git pull` before we began our changes). 

Of course the best way to avoid it is to try and always make sure your branch is up to date and to work on completely different sections. 

If it happens we will just deal with it but let's try avoid it xD 


**Note**

I've tried my best to be as comprehensive as possible in this so that any new-hackathoners and those who are new to branching and PRs can be informed, but overall we will deal with any potential issues as a team. :D
