        <h2>Five impressive women to choose from</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
            <img class="img-bio" src="assets/imgs/ada_lovelace.jpg" alt="Ada Lovelace">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Born on December 10, 1815, in London, England.
                Lovelace was the daughter of Lord Byron, a famous poet, and his wife Annabella Milbanke, a mathematician and writer.
                Lovelace showed an early aptitude for mathematics and science and was encouraged in her studies by her mother.
            </p>
            <h4>Achievements, Legacy & Impact</h4>
            <p>
                In 1833, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor who had developed plans for a machine he called the "Analytical Engine," which was designed to perform complex mathematical calculations. 
                Lovelace became fascinated by Babbage's ideas and worked with him on the development of the machine.
                Lovelace is credited with writing the world's first computer program, which was designed to be run on the Analytical Engine.
                In her notes on the machine, Lovelace outlined a method for calculating a sequence of numbers known as the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine.
                Lovelace's contributions to the development of computing were largely unrecognized during her lifetime, but she is now considered a pioneer in the field. 
                She is celebrated each year on "Ada Lovelace Day," which is an international celebration of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.
                Lovelace died on November 27, 1852, at the age of 36, but her work continues to inspire generations of scientists and computer programmers around the world.

            <h3>Katherine Johnson</h3>
            <img class="img-bio" src="assets/imgs/katherine-johnson.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Born August 26, 1918, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.</p>
            <h4>Achievements, Legacy & Impact</h4>
            <p>
                Johnson graduated from West Virginia State College with degrees in mathematics and French in 1937.
                After completing her education, she taught at a black public school in Virginia for several years before joining the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor to NASA, in 1953.
                At NACA, Johnson worked as a "human computer," performing complex calculations by hand for aeronautical research. 
                She was part of a team of black women known as "computers" who played a crucial role in the development of the American space program.
                In the early 1960s, Johnson was assigned to the Space Task Group, where she played a key role in the development of the first manned spaceflight programs. 
                She was responsible for calculating the trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo missions, including the flight of John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth.
                Johnson received numerous awards and honors for her contributions to the space program, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 2015. 
                She was the subject of the book and film "Hidden Figures," which tells the story of the black women who worked at NACA and NASA during the early days of the American space program.
                Johnson passed away on February 24, 2020, at the age of 101. She is remembered as a pioneer in the field of space exploration and a trailblazer for women and people of color in STEM fields.

            <h3>Grace Hopper</h3>
            <img class="img-bio" src="assets/imgs/grace-hopper.jpg" alt="Grace Hopper">
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Born on May 30, 1975, in Wausau, Wisconsin.</p>
            <h4>Achievements, Legacy & Impact</h4>
            <p>
                Mayer earned a bachelor's degree in symbolic systems and a master's degree in computer science from Stanford University. 
                After graduating, she joined Google in 1999 as the company's 20th employee and its first female engineer.
                At Google, Mayer played a key role in the development of some of the company's most successful products, including Google Search, Google Images, and Google Maps. 
                She ultimately rose to the position of Vice President of Local, Maps, and Location Services.
                In 2012, Mayer was hired as the President and CEO of Yahoo!, making her one of the most prominent female executives in the technology industry. 
                During her tenure at Yahoo!, Mayer oversaw a major overhaul of the company's products and services, and helped to revive the company's fortunes after a period of decline.
                In 2017, Mayer left Yahoo! following the company's acquisition by Verizon Communications. 
                She has since been involved in several technology startups and has served on the boards of several prominent companies, including Walmart and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
                Mayer has been recognized for her contributions to the technology industry and her philanthropic efforts. She has been named one of the world's most powerful women by Forbes magazine and has received numerous awards for her work in the field of computer science. She continues to be active in the technology industry and is considered one of the most influential women in Silicon Valley.
